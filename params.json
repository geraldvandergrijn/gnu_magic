It uses look up tables containing results from libRadtran, a radiative transfer model, to efficiently and accurately determine solar irradiance at the earth's surface. It also contains an interface for satellite based cloud information.\r\n\r\nGNU MAGIC has been used by [CM SAF](http://www.cmsaf.eu) to produce essential climate variable datasets from Meteosat imagery dating back to 1983. It was also used to produce the European and African solar atlas, [PVGIS](http://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvgis/). It is currently being expanded to allow the use of further satellites.\r\n\r\n### How does it work?\r\nGNU MAGIC is well documented, both in peer reviewed publications and in technical documents. Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/erget/gnu_magic/wiki) for information about how to use GNU MAGIC, what scientific principles it uses and how well it validates against ground-based measurements.\r\n\r\n### Want to get involved?\r\n[Visit the project on GitHub](https://github.com/erget/gnu_magic)! There you can [register an issue](https://github.com/erget/gnu_magic/issues) or [write a wiki article](https://github.com/erget/gnu_magic/wiki).

The GNU MAGIC code is currently being developed on GitHub. The repository is administrated by Daniel Lee (@erget).","google":""}
