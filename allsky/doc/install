[1]  If not already installed  on your maching please install the {\it netcdf} library (software). Netcdf is freely available, you can download it from the web (google,netcdf). Netcdf is not needed by MAGIC but recommended !

[2] Download magic-vN.tar.bz2  and put it
in the disered directory, N is the version number. 
Uncompress it with:
                    bunzip2 magic-vN.tar.bz2
Afterwards unpack it using
                    tar xvf magic-vN.tar

[3] Within the chosen directory you have now a directory {MAGICvN}, 
where N is the version number.
In this directory you will find the source code, a pre-compiled binary and example configuration and script files. In the subdirectories {climatologies} and {luts} the needed climatologies and
look-up table(s) are located.
Go to the{\it MAGICvN} directory and type
                  gcc -lm -m32 magic-vN.c -o magic-vN.exe



Magic has been tested and compiled with gcc-3.3 and gcc-4.2. 
It is important to link the mathematical library (-lm flag, or -lmathlib)
and it might be reasonable to compile with -m32 (32 bit mode).
The name of the executable is defined with the -o flag.
If you use another C compiler, please look in the manual for the 
associated flags.
If the compilation works fine test MAGIC with
        magic-vN.exe
